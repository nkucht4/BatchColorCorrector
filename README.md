## How to use
1. Pick photos you want to edit.
2. Apply all desired color corrections. The channels that the tool allows you to edit are:
 - Red
 - Green
 - Blue
 - Hue
 - Saturation
 - Value
 - Lightness
3. Don't forget to click the "Okay" button after finding the perfect value of each parameter, otherwise your change won't be saved and will be removed when you change the value of other slider or change displayed photo.
4. Press "Save All" and choose a directory in which you want your files to be saved. The "BCC" prefix will be added to your exported images to avoid overwriting the original files.
